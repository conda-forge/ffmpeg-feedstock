# These could be wrong, but I'm not too sure how to find an exact correspondance
# between the cuda version and the nvidia driver version
# I think they could technically be out of sync
# To find the compatibility version of ffnvcodec_headers, you can look at the
# https://github.com/FFmpeg/nv-codec-headers/tree/n12.0.16.1
# To find the __cuda version I:
# Uninstall all nvidia driver from ubuntu
# Installed a specific version they offered
# rebooted
# Checked what was reported by conda info
# sudo apt remove *nvidia*
# sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470
# sudo reboot
# conda info | grep cuda
# I checked the following versions
#     - nvidia-driver-550 -- cuda 12.4
#     - nvidia-driver-535 -- cuda 12.2
#     - nvidia-driver-530 -- seems to install 535...
#     - nvidia-driver-525 -- seems to install 535...
#     - nvidia-driver-520 -- seems to install 535...
#     - nvidia-driver-515 -- seems to install 535...
#     - nvidia-driver-510 -- seems to install 535...
#     - nvidia-driver-470 -- Did not work on my machine (likely GPU too new)
